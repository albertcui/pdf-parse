Acute effect of speed exercise on nitric oxide (NO)
level of footballers
Aim:Exercise  is  one  of  the  low-cost  and  easiest  ways  for  improving  life  standards  and  physical
fitness, and reducing body stress. Nitric oxide (NO) is defined as the “surprising soldier mediator”
of biological systems. NO is one of the relaxation factors coming from the vascular endothelium.
This relaxation in smooth muscles leads to vasodilatation in veins. The purpose of this study is to
evaluate the acute effect of 20-meter sprints of footballers on NO levels.
Materials and Methods:22 footballers with an age range of 18–32 were voluntarily enrolled in the
study. The heights and weights of the subjects were measured. Speed measures were taken with a
photocell system. The 20-meter sprint was repeated for 10 times. Blood samples were taken before
and immediately after the sprint. For statistical analysis paired t test was used. 
Results:The  mean  age,  height,  and  weight  of  the  footballers  included  in  the  study  were  24.21  ±
3.41 years, 173 ± 7.04 cm, and 67.85 ± 5.17 kg, respectively. The mean NO values were 21.45 ± 2.08
immediately after the exercise and 25.59 ± 1.59 before the exercise (mean ± SD). This decrease in
the NO level after the exercise, compared to before, were not statistically meaningful (P = 0.052).
Conclusions:The  fact  that  the  exercise  was  short-term  yet  with  maximal  load  and  negative
developments  occurred  within  the  body  may  have  highlighted  the  oxidative  damage.  The  NO
defence used against this damage may have decreased the values.

Futbolcularda sürat egzersizinin nitrik oksit (NO)
düzeyi üzerine akut etkisi
Amaç:Egzersiz,  insanları  stresten  uzaklaştıran,  hayat  standartlarını  yükselten  ve  fiziksel
uygunluğu  iyi  duruma  getirmek  için  kullanılan  en  ucuz  ve  kolay  yoldur.  Nitrik  oksit  (NO)
biyolojik sistemlerin “şaşırtıcı asker aracısı” olarak tanımlanır. NO vasküler endotelyumdan çıkan
dinlenme  faktörüdür.  Bu  düz  kaslardaki  relaks  damarlarla  vasodilatasyona  neden  olur.  Bu
çalışmanın  amacı;  futbolcularda  20  metrelik  sürat  koşularının  NO  düzeylerine  akut  etkisini
araştırmaktır. 
Gereç  ve  Yöntem:Araştırmaya  yaşları  18-32  yaş  arasında  değişen  22  futbolcu  gönüllü  olarak
katıldı.  Deneklerin  boy  ve  beden  ağırlık  ölçümleri  alındı.  Sürat  ölçümleri  fotosel  ile  yapıldı.  20
metrelik sürat koşusu 10 kez tekrar ettirildi. Sürat egzersizi öncesi ve hemen sonrası kan örnekleri
alındı. İstatistiksel analiz için paired t testi kullanıldı. 
Bulgular:Çalışmaya dahil edilen futbolcuların yaşları 24,21 ± 3,41 yıl, boyları 173 ± 7,04 cm. ve
beden ağırlığı 67,85 ± 5,17 kg. olarak belirlendi.Sürat  egzersizi  öncesi  NO  değerleri  25,59  ±
1,59’  iken,  egzersiz  hemen  sonrası  21,45  ±  2,08  olarak  bulundu  (A.O  ±  SS).  Egzersizden  hemen
sonrasındaki NO düzeyindeki bu düşüş istatistiksel olarak anlamlı değildi (P = 0,052).
Sonuç:Egzersizin  kısa  süreli  ancak  maksimal  yüklenmeli  olması,  vücutta  meydana  gelen  negatif
gelişmeler  oksidatif  hasarı  öne  çıkarmış  olabilir.  Bu  hasara  karşı  kullanılan  NO  savunması,
değerleri aşağıya düşürmüş olabilir.

Introduction
Until  15-20  years  ago,  NO  was  thought  to  be
merely    the    exhaust    gas    of    automobiles,    an
atmospheric  gas  found  in  cigarettes,  and  an  agent
polluting the atmosphere. It has been articulated in
previous  studies  that  NO,  which  has  been  qualified
as a harmful molecule since it is a free radical due to
the   unpaired   electron   it   bore,   is   actually   an
important molecule that balances the blood pressure
and vasodilatation (1,2).
NO causes vasodilatation in veins and accelerates
blood   flow.   NO,   which   regulates   the   blood
circulation,  also  keeps  the  veins  clean.  The  vein
network rich in NO is slippery like Teflon and allows
for  the  flow  of  plaques  preventing  the  enlargement
of clots, whereas the unhealthy vein, or the vein poor
in NO, leads to collection of plaques in the adhesive
inner surface of the vein (3,4). 
NO  radical  prevents  the  excessive  accumulation
of free radicals in tissues by reacting with other free
radicals  (5,6).  Whereas  other  free  oxygen  radicals
are harmful in every concentration, NO plays a role
in regulating a range of physiological events, such as
digestion  system,  host  defence  and  non-specific
immunity.         However,         when         generated
inappropriately  and  excessively,  it  causes  a  lot  of
pathological conditions (7).
Sport generally has significant features like speed,
strength,  endurance,  and  flexibility.  Speed  is  the
ability to carry oneself from one point to another in
the shortest time possible (8).
In  sports  trainings,  the  organism  is  exposed  to
loads which are over daily life levels. In exercise, it is
blood  that  provides  the  metabolic  and  O
2
needs  of
the  tissues.  Blood  pressure  is  the  force  that  enables
the  blood  flow.  Blood  pressure  is  the  pressure  that
exerts the blood on the vein walls (9). 
The  benefits  of  exercising  have  been  proven
plenty of times. However, negative changes can also
be  expected  in  connection  with  the  short-term  and
extreme  changes  that  exercise  may  cause  in  the
human   body.   However,   exercise,   if   performed
regularly   and   efficiently,   helps   strengthen   the
cardiovascular, hormonal, and immune system, and
increase the muscle mass. 
This  study  was  conducted  to  analyze  the  acute
effect of speed exercise on NO levels of footballers. 
Materials and Methods
Selection of the Subjects
Twenty-two  active,  healthy  footballers,  with  an
age range of 18-32, free of obvious health problems
and medications were enrolled into this study. In the
study,  the  necessary  explanations  were  provided  to
the subjects and their consents were obtained. 
Method of the Study
The  subjects  carried  out  the  test  after  a  20-min
warm-up, 15 min of which was dedicated to general
and 5 min to specific warm-up. The test comprised
10  sprints  of  20  m.  The  subjects  started  the  sprint
without  a  start  order,  but  when  they  felt  ready  and
completed  it  in  maximum  speed.  Blood  measures
were  taken  twice,  before  and  immediately  after the
sprint. 
Instruments
Height and Weight Measure
The  heights  of  the  subjects  were  measured
without  shoes,  with  a  stadiometer  (Holtain,  UK)  in
cm;  and  they  were  weighed  in  shorts  with  an
electronic scale (Seca, Germany) in kg. 
Speed Measure
The  speed  was  measured  in  a  gym  on  a  smooth
and synthetic floor. The time between the start and
finish  points  were  measured  with  a  0.01  s  sensitive
photocell  system  (New  Test  2000,  Finland).  Cones
were used in order to specify the sprint field. 
Blood Measures
Blood samples were drown from antecubital vein
using the heparinised tubes. The samples were taken
before  and  immediately  after  the  loading.  The
elements were precipitated by centrifuge for 5 min at
3500 rpm; the plasma part at the top was taken into
Eppendorf tubes and kept at -80 °C until analysis.
Nitrite determination
Nitrite  was  measured  using  the  Griess  reaction
(10). Briefly,  plasma  samples  were  diluted  4-fold
with  distilled  water  and  deproteinized  by  adding
l/20th volume of zinc sulfate (300 g/l) to give a final

concentration  of  15  g/l.  After  centrifugation  at
10,000×g for 5 min at room temperature (or 1000×g
for  15  min),  100  μl  of  supernate  was  applied  to  a
microtiter  plate  well,  followed  by  100/μl  of  Griess
reagent (1 g/l sulfanilamide, 25 g/l phosphoric acid,
and 0.1 g/l N-1-naphthylethylenediamine). After 10
min  of  colour  development  at  room  temperature,
the  absorbance  was  measured  on  a  microplate
reader  (Tiertek  Multiskan  MCC/340;  Flow  Lab,
McLean,  VA)  at  a  wavelength  of  540  nm.  Each
sample  was  assayed  in  duplicate  wells.  Background
values   were   obtained   by   treating   samples   as
described  but  by  using  25  g/l  phosphoric  acid
instead  of  complete  Griesa  reagent.  Calibra  tion
curves  were  genereated  with  sodium  nitrite  and
potas  sium  nitrate  in  distilled  water  (linear  range  0-
100 μmol/l). The detection limit of the assay is ~1.5
μmol/l  in  distilled  water.  There  was  no  difference
between the spectrum of authentic nitrite in distilled
water  and  the  spectra  of  negative  plasma  samples
supplemented with exogenous nitrite or the spectra
of  positive  plasma  samples.  In  all  these  specimens,
max  imal  absorbance  occurred  at  540  nm  (data  not
shown).  The  molar  absorptivity  of  the  coloured
product was 39,500 l mol

cm

Nitrate determination
Nitrate  was  measured  as  ni  trite  after  enzymatic
conversion  by  nitrate  reductase  (EC  1.6.6.2)  as
described  by  Schmidt  et  al.  (11).  Briefly,  100  μl  of
plasma  was  diluted  4-fold  with  distilled  water.
NADPH,    FAD,    and    nitrate    reductase    from
Aspergillusspp.       (Boehringer       Mannheim,
Mannheim,  Ger  many)  were  added  to  yield  final
concentrations  of  50  μmol/,  5  μmol/l,  and  200  U/l,
respectively. 
Samples  were  further  incubated  for  5  min  at  37
°C  to  oxidize  NADPH  [which  interferes  with  the
assay]  (11), deproteinized,  and  assayed  with  Griess
reagent as described above. Values obtained by this
procedure  represent  the  sum  of  nitrite  and  nitrate.
Nitrate concentrations were obtained by subtracting
nitrite concentrations from the total nitrate + nitrite
concentrations.
Statistical Analysis
SPSS   16.0   statistics   program   was   used   in
analysing  the  data  obtained.  The  arithmetic  mean
and  standard  deviation  of  all  the  variants  of  the
footballers  included  in  the  study  were  calculated.
Paired  samples  t-test  was  used  to  compare  the  NO
values taken before and immediately after the speed
exercise.  The  difference  was  assumed  significant  if
the p value was below 0.05. 
Results
The  demographic  results  of  the  group  were
summarized  in  Tables  1  and  2.  NO  values  were
found  to  be  21.45  ±  2.08  immediately  after  the
exercise  whereas  they  were  25.59  ± 1.59  before  the
exercise.   This   decrease   immediately   after   the
exercise,  in  comparison  with  before,  was  not  a
statistically significant (P = 0.052, Figure 1).

Discussion
Recent  studies  show  that  exercise  has  different
effects  on  NO  level.  Presumed  reasons  for  those
differences  are  the  type,  duration,  and  degree  of
exercise.  Particularly  acute  and  heavy  exercises  can
trigger  oxidative  damage  (12).  The  proportions  of
oxidants  and  antioxidants  to  emerge  during  the
exercise  vary  according  to  the  degree  of  exercise.
While  damaging  oxidant  system  is  more  activated
during  heavy  and  rigorous  exercises,  regular  and
short-term  sport  activities  that  are  not  maximal
activate the antioxidant systems better (13). 
There   are   various   basic   sources   of   oxidant
products,  such  as  NO  products,  oxygen  radicals
formed     through     purine     metabolism,     and
prostaglandin. NO products, like peroxinitrites, can
contribute  to  oxidative  damage (14).  NO,  thus,  can
contribute to cell damage in many cells. 
Xia and colleagues studied the effect of different
degrees  of  exercise  on  NO  level  and  they  showed
that  there  was  no  significant  change  in  NO  in  low
and  mild  level  exercises,  whereas  there  was  an
increase in NO concentration in high level exercises
(15).  In  contrast  to  that  study,  we  noted  that  there
was a 5 U/ml decrease in NO levels after the exercise
in  comparison  with  those  before  the  exercise.  This
can  be  attributed  to  a  set  of  factors.  One  of  them  is
the contribution of NO to antioxidant defence in the
fight  with  free  radicals  occurring  in  acute  exercises
of maximal level (16). 
Yamamato et al. state that there is no meaningful
difference between the plasma and serum NO levels
before  and  immediately  after  exercise  for  aerobic
type physical exercise (17). 
In another study, Keçetepen and Dursun found a
decrease in NO values immediately after exercise in
a  study  where  sportsmen,  who  do  sports  regularly,
perform  exercise  for  2  min  consecutively  at  30,  40,
50   km/h   against   100   W   power,   and   then   at
maximum speed, using a bicycle ergometer (18).
Radak et al. also state that muscular damage can
occur  in  connection  with  the  increase  in  NO
X
production  in  skeletal  muscles  during  eccentric
contraction (19).  Cuzzolin  et  al.  state  in  the  study
they carried out on 6 active and 6 sedentary subjects
that acute exercise can lead to NO
X
formation (20).
In  another  study,  a  decrease  was  observed  in
nitric  oxide  synthesis  inhibition  and  active  blood
flow after the dynamic knee-extensor exercise. In the
same  study,  NO  inhibition  was  greater  in  heavy
exercise when compared with low level exercise (21).
Another study concludes that NO is not essential
for  the  good  performance  of  skeleton  muscles  in
healthy humans (22).
Jungestern et al. compared long-distance runners
and  students  who  do  not  exercise  regularly  and
came  up  with  a  meaningful  difference  in  NO  levels
of    long    distance    runners    after    exercise    in
comparison      with      those      before      exercise.
Furthermore,  there  was  a  meaningful  increase  in
NO levels of students who do not exercise regularly
after exercise in comparison with before (23). 
In our study, the NO levels may have been found
to  be  low  for  that  moment  since  the  blood  samples
were taken immediately after maximal loading. As a
result  of  the  increase  in  radicals  during  heavy
exercise,  it  is  possible  for  some  of  the  NO  to  be
directed to radicals. However, different results could
have been obtained if blood samples had been taken
at regular intervals after exercise. 
The fact that the exercise was short-term yet with
maximal  load  and  the  negative  developments  that
occurred within the body may have highlighted the
oxidative damage. The NO defence used against this
damage may have decreased the values.
